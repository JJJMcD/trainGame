# 🚂 Train Survival Game

A western-inspired survival game made in Unity, where players ride and manage a train through hostile territory filled with zombies, gunmen, and more. Developed as a collaborative project by a group of friends.

## 🎮 Game Concept

Set in a stylized western world, the player controls a moving train that must be constantly fueled and defended. Travel through dynamic settlements, explore diverse buildings, and fight off enemies who attempt to board or ambush the train.

### Core Features

- 🛤️ **Moving Train Gameplay**: The train continuously moves through various regions unless manually stopped at key points.
- 🔧 **Train Upgrades**: Customize and upgrade the train with improved armor, speed, carriages, and visual styles.
- ⛽ **Fuel Management**: Players must gather and manage fuel, available at midway shops or friendly settlements.
- ☠️ **Enemy Encounters**: Defend against waves of zombies, gunmen, and other threats as they attempt to halt your journey.
- 🏙️ **Settlements & Events**: Interact with towns and random events—trade, repair, or fight for supplies.
